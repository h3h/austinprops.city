title: Proposition D – Flood Mitigation & Water Quality
permalink: /:year/proposition-d

---

Proposition D is about funding "flood mitigation and control, erosion control,
water quality, water quantity, and storm-water drainage."

The city wants to be able to:

* Install improvements and facilities for flood control, erosion control, water
  quality, and storm-water drainage.
* Acquiring land and open spaces for conservation and preservation.

In order to fund these activities, the city is proposing an issuance
of <nobr><strong>$184 million</strong></nobr> in new bonds, noting that city
property taxes will be used to fund the interest and maturity on those bonds.

## Evaluation

The relevance of this bond is magnified by the recent events of the Llano river.
Stormwater management will be increasingly important as the magnitude and
frequency of storms increase. Passing any budget increase in water management
benefits all Austinites, present and future. Additionally, green stormwater
infrastructure has been measured to alleviate heat islands, reduce biodiversity
loss, support physical and mental health, and improve the population's general
quality of life ([Dagenais, et. al](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01426397.2016.1228861)).

Usually, cities will purchase easements and additional land near floodplains to
prevent development in vulnerable areas. These easements are usually a good idea
and help prevent catastrophes for decades to come. Though you should vote for
this bond, also keep in mind that the city should take additional steps to help
alleviate pains felt during drought. It's easy to forget that just a few years
ago, Lake Travis was almost empty. Bonds such as these can be applied to build
smarter retention systems. Cisterns and grey water management systems can lead
to lower water bills! Collecting and harvesting rain water for lawn and waste
management is a smart idea. Advocate for these changes and think about applying
them to your own home so you can lower your water bills while helping the
environment.

Austin already has a few existing green stormwater infrastructure projects,
Shoal Creek being a prime example. This bond ensures these projects continue
to improve the lives of citizens living near and far from existing waterways.
This bond will also help efforts to prevent additional erosion tragedies such as
the May landslide on North Lamar ([Statesman](https://www.statesman.com/NEWS/20180510/Landslide-along-Shoal-Creek-leaves-homeowners-facing-uncertainty)).

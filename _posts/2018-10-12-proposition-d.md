Proposition D is about funding "flood mitigation and control, erosion control,
water quality, water quantity, and storm-water drainage."

The city wants to be able to:

* Install improvements and facilities for flood control, erosion control, water
  quality, and storm-water drainage.
* Acquiring land and open spaces for conservation and preservation.

In order to fund these activities, the city is proposing an issuance
of <nobr><strong>$184 million</strong></nobr> in new bonds, noting that city
property taxes will be used to fund the interest and maturity on those bonds.

Proposition C is about funding "public parks, recreation centers, natural areas,
and other related facilities" like pools, hike and bike trails, and parking for
those things.

The city wants to be able to:

* Plan, acquire, construct, renovate, improve and equip such facilities
* Buy land in pursuit of those goals
* Take out loans to support those activities

In order to fund these activities, the city is proposing an issuance
of <nobr><strong>$149 million</strong></nobr> in new bonds, noting that city
property taxes will be used to fund the interest on those bonds.

Proposition 1 is about providing a funding boost for Texas technical colleges.

Per [KUT News][KU]:

> This amendment would create two new funds to support the Texas State Technical
> College System, which provides job training and career-focused education
> across the state.

> Unlike Texas universities, the technical college system doesn't have the power
> to collect local taxes. Instead, the money for these funds could come from
> several places, including money set aside by the Legislature, interest the
> funds earn over time and any private gifts, grants or donations.

Absent political mucking with the allocation of these funds, more and better
education is better for Texans.

**Recommendation:** Yes

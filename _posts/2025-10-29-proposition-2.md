Proposition 2 is about banning capital gains tax.

Per [KUT News][KU]:

> This amendment would constitutionally ban taxes on capital gains made from
> selling stocks or other investments.

> Capital gains taxes are already effectively banned in Texas, only because
> they've been interpreted to fall under the state's ban on an income tax. But
> the proposition's author points to the state of Washington, which successfully
> defended its tax on capital gains in court, arguing some weren't protected by
> the state's law against income taxes.

If the people elect representatives who are able to garner enough support to
pass a capital gains tax, they should be able to do so without restrictions in
the state constitution from prior-decade or -century constituents.

**Recommendation:** No

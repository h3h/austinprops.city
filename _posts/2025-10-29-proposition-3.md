Proposition 3 is about mandatory bail denial.

Per [KUT News][KU]:

> Senate Joint Resolution 5 would require judges and magistrates to deny bail to
> people accused of certain violent or sexual felonies, which is allowed but not
> mandated in the current state constitution. That includes murder, aggravated
> assault causing serious bodily injury, aggravated sexual assault and human
> trafficking.

Mandatory sentencing laws (or constitutional amendments!) are a nightmare.
Judges should always be free to exercise their discretion in determining bail.
That’s what judges are for.

**Recommendation:** No

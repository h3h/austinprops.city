title: Proposition K – Require Additional Third-Party City Auditor
permalink: /:year/proposition-k
---

Proposition K is about requiring the city to get an external auditor to look for
ways it can save money. The ballot language for this proposition is rather terse
and somewhat confusing, so be sure to read carefully below.


## Questions

### What is the "existing internal City Auditor" referenced in the ballot language?

This is a refernce to the [Office of the City Auditor][1], which according to
[that office's FAQ document][2] "conducts performance audits not financial
audits". Supporters of Proposition K also claim that the Office of the City
Auditor is much too small to perform a comprehensive financial audit in a useful
timescale.

### What is the "existing independent external auditor" in the ballot language?

According to Ed English (who was involved in [a law suit aganst the City Council
over the ballot language for this proposition][3]), this is a reference to the
accounting firm that the city currently contracts. Accounting and auditing are
distinct tasks, of course, and English claims that existing firm only ensures
the books balance, rather than looking for savings and that a dedicated city
auditing firm would be better suited to the task.

### How much does it cost?

The $1-5 million price range from the ballot language is, again according to
English, a typical fee that firms that do this kind of audit charge cities. He
claims that many such firms also work on spec, being paid, say, 1% of realized
(rather than recommended) savings. If the city contracted with such a firm, the
payment to them wouldn't have to come from any corner of the existing city
budget.

### How much might we save?

According to English, a typical "low" result for cities like Austin that get
audits like this done would be to find 4-5% of the total budget in realized
savings. Using [next year's budget][4] as an example (roughly $4.1 billion), if
the city realized only 1% of the budget in savings, that would represent $41
million saved.

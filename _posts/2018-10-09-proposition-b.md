title: Proposition B
---

Proposition B is about funding “community and cultural” facilities, including libraries, museums, art and creative
spaces, which are “dedicated to the creation, exhibition, or preservation of art and creative expression.”

Similar to Proposition A, the city wants to be able to:

* Plan, design, construct, renovate and equip such community and cultural facilities
* Buy land to support additional community and cultural facilities
* Take out loans to support those activities

In order to fund these activities, the city is proposing an issuance of <nobr><strong>$128 million</strong></nobr> in
new bonds, noting that city property taxes will be used to fund the interest and maturity on those bonds.

Proposition 13 increases the school tax exemption for homeowners.

Per [KUT News][KU]:

> Senate Joint Resolution 2 would boost the state's homestead exemption — again,
> the portion of a home's value that cannot be taxed to pay for public schools —
> to $140,000, up from the current level of $100,000.

Once again, another way to cut school funding that the state legislature has no
intention of making up in any other way. Let’s try to have educated future
Texans, shall we?

**Recommendation:** No

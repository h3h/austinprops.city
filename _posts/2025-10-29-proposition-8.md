Just like Proposition 2 and Proposition 6, Proposition 8 is about banning
imagined future taxes; this time: inheritance taxes.

Per [KUT News][KU]:

> House Joint Resolution 2 would prohibit the Legislature from imposing "death
> taxes" applicable to a decedent's property or the transfer of an estate,
> inheritance, legacy, succession or gift.

> Though Texas does not currently have an inheritance tax, this measure aims to
> prevent lawmakers from trying to impose a tax on an estate or when an estate
> or inheritance is transferred.

We do not need to prevent the future legislature from taxing… you know the drill
by now.

**Recommendation:** No

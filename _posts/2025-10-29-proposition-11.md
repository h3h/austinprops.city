Proposition 11 gives a school property tax exemption for homeowners who are
disabled or over 65.

Per [KUT News][KU]:

> Senate Joint Resolution 85 would boost the amount of the state's homestead
> exemption — the portion of a home's value that cannot be taxed to pay for
> public schools — for residents over 65 or those who have a disability to
> $60,000, up from the current level of $10,000. Together with another
> constitutional amendment on the ballot, Proposition 13, this could lift the
> total homestead exemption for these individuals to $200,000, with an average
> annual tax savings of about $907.

> If the amendment is approved, the state would have to make up for revenue
> school districts would no longer collect. That could cost Texas about $1.2
> billion in the 2026-2027 budget cycle, falling to $477 million per year
> afterwards before starting to climb again, according to the fiscal note
> attached to the accompanying legislation, Senate Bill 23.

This is exactly the kind of heinous dichotomy one can expect from the Texas
Legislature. _Should we reduce the tax burden on old people or fail to educate
children?_

The same legislators have already shown that they will cut school funding, so
I am not inclined to swing the axe for them, despite the impact on older people.

**Recommendation:** No

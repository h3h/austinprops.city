Proposition 17 introduces tax breaks for landowners in counties that border
Mexico.

Per [KUT News][KU]:

> This amendment would allow the state Legislature to create a property tax
> exemption for landowners in counties that border Mexico.

> The exemption would apply only to increases in a property's value that come
> from installing or building border security infrastructure, like fencing or
> surveillance systems.

> If approved, lawmakers could pass laws giving property owners in those border
> counties the option to claim this exemption on their tax bills.

**Recommendation:** No

Proposition Q allows a tax rate increase beyond the new state limit without
voter approval, which is 3.5% (it used to be 8%).

Per [KUT News][KU]:

> In August, the Austin City Council approved a $6.3 billion budget but called
> on voters to approve a higher tax rate. On the November ballot as Proposition
> Q, the rate of 57.4 cents per $100 of taxable value would generate nearly $110
> million for the 2025-26 fiscal year. That money would be used to help reduce
> homelessness, improve parks and enhance public safety.

> Austin was already facing a $33 million budget shortfall that city officials
> have attributed to sales tax and property tax revenues not bouncing back
> following the COVID-19 pandemic.

> There has also been a cut to some federal funding that the city depended on to
> help pay for critical services like emergency shelter for people who are
> unhoused and rental assistance programs. The council has said the city would
> need to foot the bill itself to keep these programs going.

It’s a bummer to pay more taxes, but it’s a reality of living in a city and
wanting good things for that city.

**Recommendation:** Yes

Proposition 4 is about water infrastructure funding.

Per [KUT News][KU]:

> House Joint Resolution 7 would dedicate a portion of state tax revenues to
> build and repair water infrastructure.

> If approved, the measure would give up to $1 billion a year in sales tax
> revenue to the Texas Water Fund, starting in 2027 and running for 20 years.
> While this would fall short of the state's water infrastructure needs, it
> would begin to address a serious problem, the measure's backers argue.

This is one of the things that Texas should be spending money on. It’s a weird
quirk of the Texan government that it has to be a constitutional amendment, but
here we are.

**Recommendation:** Yes

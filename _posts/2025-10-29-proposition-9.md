Proposition 9 would provide a property tax exemption for landlords and business
owners.

Per [KUT News][KU]:

> House Joint Resolution 1 would increase the property tax exemption for
> business properties from $2,500 to $125,000 of the market value of their
> property.

> The amendment would apply to personal property used for business purposes —
> things like inventory, vehicles and supplies. The amendment doesn't apply to
> real estate and would impact properties that are owned or leased.

Won’t someone think of the landlords? Give me the largest possible break.

**Recommendation:** No

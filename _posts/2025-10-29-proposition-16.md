Proposition 16 clarifies that only citizens can vote in Texas.

Per [KUT News][KU]:

> This proposition clarifies that a voter must be a U.S. citizen and registered
> in Texas to cast a ballot. Proponents say that's important because the state's
> constitution doesn't explicitly limit noncitizens from voting.

> While current Texas law already limits voting to citizens, this measure
> codifies that restriction to prevent future legal or policy changes allowing
> noncitizen voting.

> There is little evidence that noncitizen voting is a widespread problem in
> Texas.

This is culture war BS inventing a problem where there is none to scare
conservative voters into giving up more power to the state government.

**Recommendation:** No

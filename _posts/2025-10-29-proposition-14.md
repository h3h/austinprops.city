Proposition 14 is about creating and funding the Dementia Prevention and
Research Institute of Texas.

Per [KUT News][KU]:

> Senate Joint Resolution 3 would create the Dementia Prevention and Research
> Institute of Texas and allocate $3 billion for research into dementia,
> Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.

> The money would come from the state's general revenue fund, and the institute
> could receive up to $300 million per year in state appropriations. The
> amendment received bipartisan support in the Legislature.

> DPRIT is modeled after the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas.
> Formed in 2009, the institute made Texas into the second-largest public funder
> of cancer research in the U.S., behind only the National Institutes of Health.

This is one of those bizarre times when massive cuts to the federal budget are
encouraging larger states to pick up the slack. So, yes, we should do this.
It’s a different battle over why our federal tax dollars are being used for…
things less wholesome than this.

**Recommendation:** Yes

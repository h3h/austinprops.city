Proposition 6 is about exempting a new Texas stock exchange from taxes.

Per [KUT News][KU]:

> If approved, this amendment would permanently bar the state from imposing
> occupation taxes on businesses like stock exchanges and broker dealers, and on
> taxing securities transactions. That means without another amendment undoing
> the action, Texas won't be able to tax the buying and selling of stocks and
> bonds.

We do not need to prevent the future legislature from taxing financial services
providers. That’s what the legislature is for.

**Recommendation:** No

Proposition 15 creates specific provisions for parents’ rights in the Texas
Constitution.

Per [KUT News][KU]:

> This resolution would change the constitution to affirm the rights and
> responsibilities of parents. But seemingly nothing would change because
> parents already have the right to care for their children, and make decisions
> concerning their upbringing.

> A 'YES' vote would solidify those rights into the Texas Constitution.

> The proposed change comes as the government has increasingly weighed in on
> what medical decisions parents can make for their children, including
> vaccinations and gender-affirming care.

> “What happens when parents disagree with the government, or each other? What
> if the parents are abusive?” said Darcy Caballero with Planned Parenthood
> Texas Votes. “By putting this language into the constitution, Prop 15 gives
> the government the power to redefine what it means to nurture, protect and
> care for a child — and it also gives them the power to change it on a whim.”

**Recommendation:** No

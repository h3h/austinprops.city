Proposition 10 gives a temporary property tax exemption for homes destroyed by
fire.

Per [KUT News][KU]:

> Senate Joint Resolution 84 would exempt homeowners whose property was
> destroyed by fire from property taxes.

> Property owners have to submit an application for an exemption to their
> county's chief appraiser no later than 180 days after the fire occurs to
> qualify. The chief appraiser will recalculate the home's value if it doesn't
> fully qualify and send an updated tax bill if needed.

Seems reasonable.

**Recommendation:** Yes

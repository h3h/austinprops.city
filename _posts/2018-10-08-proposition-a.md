Proposition A is about providing affordable housing for those with low or moderate incomes.

Specifically, the city wants to be able to:

* Plan, design, construct, renovate and equip affordable housing facilities
* Buy land to support additional affordable housing
* Take out loans to support those activities

In order to fund these activities, the city is proposing an issuance of <nobr><strong>$250 million</strong></nobr> in
new bonds, noting that city property taxes will be used to fund the interest and maturity on those bonds.

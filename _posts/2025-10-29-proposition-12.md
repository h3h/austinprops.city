Proposition 12 changes who disciplines state judges and how.

Per [KUT News][KU]:

> Senate Joint Resolution 27 would change the makeup of the commission that
> disciplines judges and adjust the Texas Supreme Court's authority "to more
> effectively sanction judges for judicial misconduct."

> The amendment would require the State Commission on Judicial Conduct, or SCJC,
> to make discipline against state judges public. Discipline can only be private
> if the judge has never been sanctioned before and isn't being accused of a
> criminal offense.

I’m no wizard, but I bet if you want judicial decisions to go your way as, say,
a governor, you could find a way to accuse a judge of a crime, no matter how
spuriously, and voila—you have another judge to do your bidding.

> Abbott has said the change is necessary to ensure transparency and accountability.

That’s all I needed to hear.

**Recommendation:** No

title: Proposition J – Require Popular Vote for Land Use Code
permalink: /:year/proposition-j
---

Proposition J is about requiring any "comprehensive rewrite" of the city land
use code to to be passed by a vote of the general electorate. Without the
proposition, any code changes need only be approved by the City Council to go
into effect.

Supporters of the proposition hope that using direct democracy (rather than
representative democracy where the electorate holds council members accountable
at reelection time) will cause the City Council to either make future rewrites
"more palatable" to the electorate or to change the code more slowly, one piece
at a time in a way that is easier to understand.


## Questions

### What does "comprehensive" mean?

This is a bit of a grey area, but there is some legal precedent for the
definition of that word based in the law suit that put Propositoin J onto the
ballot. With this wording, there exists room for debate that might have to be
settled in court in the future.


## Evaluation

TBD


## Original city notice

> Shall a City ordinance be adopted to require both a waiting period and
> subsequent voter approval period, a total of up to three years, before future
> comprehensive revisions of the City’s land development code become effective?

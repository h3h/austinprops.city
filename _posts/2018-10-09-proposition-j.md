Proposition J is about requiring any "comprehensive rewrite" of the city land
use code to to be passed by a vote of the general electorate. Without the
proposition, any code changes need only be approved by the City Council to go
into effect.


## Original city notice

> Shall a City ordinance be adopted to require both a waiting period and
> subsequent voter approval period, a total of up to three years, before future
> comprehensive revisions of the City’s land development code become effective?

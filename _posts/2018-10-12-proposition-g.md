Specifically, the city wants to be able to:

* Improve roads, streets, intersections, sidewalks, bridges, urban trails,
  and related utility and drainage infrastructure.
* Install & improve traffic signals and their synchronization and control
  systems.

In order to fund these activities, the city is proposing an issuance
of <nobr><strong>$160 million</strong></nobr> in new bonds, noting that city
property taxes will be used to fund the interest on those bonds.

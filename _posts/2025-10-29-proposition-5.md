Proposition 5 is about animal feed tax exemption.

Per [KUT News][KU]:

> Animal feed is almost entirely tax exempt, from cultivation to retail sale.
> But animal feed in retail inventory awaiting sale is subject to personal
> property tax.

> Proposition 5 seeks to close that gap. If approved by voters, House Joint
> Resolution 99 would give the Legislature the ability to exempt animal feed in
> retailers' inventories from personal property taxes as well as set rules and
> limitations on the exemption.

This is very inside-baseball, with specific retailers pushing on the state
government to exempt animal feed in their inventories from personal property
taxes. As KUT News notes, this would be a strange carve-out because all other
inventory is already subject to personal property taxes. So this would give
special treatment to retailers who sell animal feed.

I am not also convinced at all that these retailers would pass on savings to
farmers. Why bother when the state will boost your profits at the stroke of
a pen?

**Recommendation:** No

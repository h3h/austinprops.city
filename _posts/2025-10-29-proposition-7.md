Proposition 7 gives a property tax break for veterans’ surviving spouses.

Per [KUT News][KU]:

> If voters approve this amendment, some surviving spouses of military veterans
> will no longer need to pay property taxes. To qualify, the widow or widower
> of a veteran couldn't remarry, and their spouse's death would have to be from
> a service-related condition or disease.

Seems reasonable. There are already several similar provisions in place.

**Recommendation:** Yes

## Contributing

Honestly, we're not looking to get writing and opinions from a wide audience.
The authors are trying to establish a consistent outlook and point of view for
the site. However, if you find typos or other errors or have suggestions, you
can [open an Issue](/h3h/austinprops.city/issues) to discuss it with us. We
appreciate your time and interest.
